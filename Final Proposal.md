**Final Proposal**
<br>I plan to create a quadruped spider using 3 motors on each leag for proper movement. My goal is to have it be able to move through space and perform sequences. If I have extra time, I plan to have it perform more advanced movements using different sensors. If all goes, well, I would like to create a more rigid and permanent body structure using like but sturdy materials like plastic or modelling foam.
