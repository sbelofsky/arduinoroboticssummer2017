For my final, I presented my quadruped robot. Each leg has three servo motors in order to have a large range of movement. The limbs connecting the servos were simple L-shaped peices of wood. The original material was foamcore however it was not strong enough and broke often. I have changed the material of the legs to a more rigid material in order to have it stand on its own. I kept the design of the structure fairly minimal because I wanted to focus on understanding the structure and coding in order to make my own structure design in the future. 

Due to my lack of knowledge on mechanical design, I realize that small mistakes (such as making the limbs too long which put strain on the servos, the shape of the wood itself was not very effective, not knowing how to use adobe Illustrator, etc...) made a big difference to the result of the robot. But thanks to the help of classmates and professors, I was able to overcome most of these challenges.

Ideally, if given more time and resources, I would have wanted this robot to be able to function as a puppet with a large range of movements. As an Illustrator and occassional animator, I wanted to see how I could translate movement into code for a robot to perform. Unfortunately I was not able to get to that point in this class however I now have the tools and knowledge to be able to do so in the future. I hope to one day have a fully functioning quadruped capable of puppetry.

<p>Due to time constraints, I was not able to properly understand the coding for PWM and so the movements the robot is able to make are only very simple such as <a href="https://github.com/sbelofsky/arduinoroboticssummer2017/blob/master/Final/coding/Robot_PWM_stand.ino">standing</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/sbelofsky/arduinoroboticssummer2017/blob/master/Final/coding/robot_PWM_sweep_all.ino">sweep</a> all the joints, and <a href="https://github.com/sbelofsky/arduinoroboticssummer2017/blob/master/Final/coding/a_very_sad_attempt_at_walking.ino"> a fairly strange attempt at walking</a>.
