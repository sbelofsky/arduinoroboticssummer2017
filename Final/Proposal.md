**Final Proposal**

<br>I plan to create a quadruped spider using 3 motors on each leag for proper movement. My goal is to have it be able to move through space and perform simple sequences. If I have extra time, I plan to have it perform more advanced movements using different sensors. For example, having it run when it hears loud noises using a mic, avoid light using LDRs, follow people using infared, etc...
<br>If all goes well, I would like to create a more rigid and permanent body structure using light but sturdy materials like plastic or modelling foam. I would also like to add artistic elements like sculpting the body to make it look interesting.
